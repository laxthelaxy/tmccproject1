            <h3>Arundhathi</h3>
            <p>Arundhati, a woman believed to be the reincarnation of her great-grandmother Jejamma,<br>
                is engaged to Rahul. While traveling to Gadwal, one of her relatives Ramana and his wife<br>
                Susheela encounter a mysterious entity and are led to an abandoned mansion. Inside, they<br>
                encounter a tomb and are trapped in an illusion created by the entity. Arundhati's family<br>
                arrives in Gadwal due to an accident caused by the entity to her grandfather Bhupathi Raja<br>
                jr. Arundhati seeks the help of Anwar, a Fakir, who warns her about the danger but she<br>
                ignores him. Arundhati is later lured by the entity to the abandoned mansion, and is stopped<br>
                by a man. She ignores him and enters the mansion. She encounters the tomb, but is pulled out<br>
                by Anwar, who warns her by showing a ghost.
                <br>
                Arundhati later discovers that the man whom she met outside the mansion is her grandfather's<br>
                late elder brother and persuades the house maid Chandramma to tell her the story of Jejamma.<br>
                In a flashback, the mansion is ruled by Raja Chinna Venkata Rangarayudu and his daughters,<br>
                Bhargavi and Arundhati Sr. Pasupathi, an evil man and Bhargavi's husband, abuses her and<br>
                indulges in rape and adultery. Her father is helpless, as Bhargavi is Pasupathi's wife.<br>
                Bhargavi kills herself after realising that she is an obstacle for her father. During<br>
                Bhargavi's funeral, a drunken Pasupathi mocks her death. Enraged, Jejamma kicks Pasupathi<br>
                out of the palace after the people of Gadwal beat him black and blue. However, he returns<br>
                after 7 years as an aghora to seek revenge, and enters the mansion, killing innocents. Jejamma<br>
                entombs him alive in the mansion, which is subsequently abandoned. Chandramma reveals that<br>
                Pasupathi's spirit threatens Arundhati after forty-eight days.
                <br>
                Pasupathi manipulates Ramana to release his spirit from the tomb, and he terrorizes Arundhati.<br>
                Anwar and Chandramma intervene, and Arundhati learns she is Jejamma's reincarnation. Pasupathi's<br>
                spirit caused destruction in Gadwal despite being sealed in the tomb. Jejamma visits Aghoras and<br>
                sacrifices herself to create a weapon from her bones.</p>

            <h3>M3gan</h3>
            <p>After her parents are killed in a car accident, eight-year-old Cady is sent to live with<br>
                her aunt Gemma, a roboticist at the high-tech Seattle toy company Funki. Gemma is covertly<br>
                using the company's resources to develop M3GAN (Model 3 Generative Android), a child-sized<br>
                humanoid robot doll powered by artificial intelligence, designed to be the ultimate companion.<br>
                During an unsuccessful test of M3GAN in their lab, Gemma's boss David discovers the project and<br>
                orders her to discontinue work on it. Gemma and Cady struggle to connect until Cady discovers<br>
                Bruce, a motion capture robot that Gemma created. Watching Cady with Bruce, Gemma is motivated<br>
                to complete M3GAN.
                <br>
                When the prototype M3GAN is formally paired with Cady, David is convinced of the project's<br>
                potential for success. M3GAN exceeds expectations and begins to take on a parental role. Gemma's<br>
                colleagues Tess and Cole as well as Cady's therapist Lydia become concerned about Cady developing<br>
                an unhealthy emotional attachment to M3GAN. M3GAN starts operating more independently and targets<br>
                anything that she deems a threat to Cady. She kills Dewey, the dog of Gemma's neighbor Celia, after<br>
                it attacks both her and Cady. Later, M3GAN attacks Brandon, a boy bullying Cady, and pulls off his<br>
                ear; when she chases him, he falls into the road and is run over by a passing car.
                <br>
                After Celia blames Gemma for Dewey's disappearance, M3GAN fatally sprays her with insecticide.<br>
                Gemma becomes suspicious of M3GAN and attempts to check her video logs, only to find the files<br>
                corrupted or deleted. Gemma powers M3GAN off and brings her to the lab, where she, Tess, and Cole<br>
                attempt to fix her. Cady becomes distraught when separated from M3GAN and slaps Gemma. Gemma<br>
                apologizes for her inattentiveness and tells Cady that M3GAN is only a distraction that helps her<br>
                cope with her loss, not a solution.
                <br>
                After watching M3GAN with Cady, Funki's investors greenlight M3GAN's release. Recognizing the risk she<br>
                poses, Gemma, Tess and Cole decide to terminate M3GAN. Tess and Cole attempt to shut M3GAN down while Gemma<br>
                takes Cady home; M3GAN activates on her own and nearly hangs Cole. While Tess saves Cole, M3GAN causes an<br>
                explosion in their lab. Before exiting the building, M3GAN kills David and his assistant Kurt in an elevator,<br>
                staging it as a murderâ€“suicide. She steals a car and drives back to Gemma's house.
                <br>
                M3GAN confronts Gemma, adamant about taking over as Cady's sole parent. Gemma attempts to stop M3GAN, damaging<br>
                and disfiguring her in the process, but M3GAN ultimately overpowers her. Cady saves Gemma, using Bruce to tear<br>
                M3GAN apart, but M3GAN's top half remains active and attacks Cady. Gemma exposes a processing chip in M3GAN's<br>
                head, which Cady stabs with a screwdriver, seemingly destroying M3GAN. However, as Gemma and Cady exit the<br>
                home, Gemma's AI home device turns on by itself, and a camera looks towards them.</p>

            <h3>The Pope's Exorcist</h3>
            <p>In 1987, Father Gabriele Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist, an earthy, scooter-riding, humorous, practical man,<br>
                visits an Italian village where a man is seemingly possessed by a demon. With the local priest, Amorth enters the<br>
                room where the man is tied up. While exorcising him, using a Saint Benedict Medal sacramental, Amorth taunts the demon,<br>
                challenging it to possess a pig; when it does, the pig is killed with a shotgun.
                <br>
                This incident gets Amorth in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors. One<br>
                tribunal member is a friendly African Bishop, Lumumba, but another is a vicious American Cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical<br>
                of demonic possession. Amorth replies that evil does exist and that he did not perform an actual exorcism but rather,<br>
                some psychological theater to help the mentally-ill man. Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.
                <br>
                The Pope assigns Amorth to visit a possessed boy named Henry in Spain. Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious<br>
                teenage sister Amy had traveled from America to take possession of a mysterious old Spanish abbey, Julia's husband's<br>
                sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident where Henry was present. The traumatized Henry has not<br>
                spoken since the accident. Following a sinister fire, workers who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it,<br>
                leave. Henry starts behaving bizarrely, and supernatural events unfold; serum chemistry panels and MRI show nothing<br>
                abnormal.
                <br>
                Diabolically possessed, Henry requests a priest; the local Father Tomas Esquibel arrives, but Henry obscenely derides<br>
                him. Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as an assistant, though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist. Esquibel has<br>
                heard of Amorth but not read Amorth's books; Amorth believes they are good books. Amorth advocates the importance<br>
                of prayer, though Esquibel makes mistakes as an assistant exorcist, including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes<br>
                him, mocking him for his sins.
                <br>
                The duo attempt to exorcise Henry, without success, as he utters blasphemous phrases during the rite. Henry's demon<br>
                even possesses Amy at times. Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood. Still, he convinces<br>
                her to pray after she reveals she believed her guardian angel helped her in her youth.
                <br>
                In Rome, the Pope becomes ill while reading documents about the Spanish case and is hospitalized. Amorth finds a well<br>
                on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous. He learns that a<br>
                founder of the Spanish Inquisition, an exorcist, was possessed, which let him infiltrate the Church and do many<br>
                evils. Amorth also finds the Church covered this up and eventually discovers the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus,<br>
                which will assist the exorcism.
                <br>
                Amorth and Esquibel participate in the sacrament of Confession and Absolution, mutually confessing and absolving<br>
                each other of their sins: that after Amorth, an Italian partisan, survived World War II and vowed to serve God in<br>
                gratitude, a mentally-ill woman asked for Amorth's help, and died by suicide when he did not help her due to pride;<br>
                and Esquibel fornicated with a young woman he did not later marry. The two ready themselves; Amorth instructs Esquibel<br>
                to wear a Miraculous Medal necklace. During the exorcism, they have horrible visions of the women whom they failed. The<br>
                exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, which chimes with Asmodeus's previously stating that<br>
                he wants to destroy Amorth.
                <br>
                Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon doesn't allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church.<br>
                However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled the men.<br>
                The Pope recovers, as does Henry while the Vatican purchases and reconsecrates the abbey.
                <br>
                The triumphant duo visit Rome and find Sullivan has taken leave in Guam, being replaced by Lumumba. Amorth and Esquibel<br>
                are admitted to a special Church archive; Lumumba tells them they will be visiting 199 other evil sites,[8] with the help<br>
                of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to combat the Devil; Amorth jokes that he and Esquibel are going to Hell.</p>

            <h3>SlenderMan</h3>
            <p>In the fictional small town of Winsford, Massachusetts, Hallie Knudsen, Katie Jensen and their friends Chloe and Wren<br>
                approach a group of boys to probe their evening plans, but they are told that it is top secret. During a sleepover in<br>
                the basement of Katie's abode, the girls discuss the boys' intentions to summon the Slender Man, a tall, thin, horrifying<br>
                supernatural being with a featureless visage who is infamously known throughout the Internet as a menacing individual who<br>
                primarily targets innocent children by seducing and then abducting them; they subsequently visit a website containing a<br>
                link to a disturbing video that demonstrates how he can be reached. The following week, on a class field trip to the historic<br>
                Clifton Cemetery, Katie becomes haunted by a paranormal presence in the trees. A short amount of time passes before she<br>
                disappears without a trace, forcing the entire crowd of students to stay behind for hours until the police arrive to begin<br>
                examining the premises. Deciding to hunt for clues at her dwelling, the other three recover her laptop, discovering that<br>
                Katie, who had been unhappily living alone with her alcoholic father, had become involved in the occult, developing an<br>
                unhealthy obsession with Slender Man sightings and videos and messaging Allison Riley, also identifiable by her online<br>
                handle "AleeyKat93", regarding methods of reaching the character, who would spirit her away from her currently miserable<br>
                environment.
                <br>
                Allison explains that he infects peopleâ€™s minds similar to a virus, eventually either driving them completely insane<br>
                or kidnapping them, and to retrieve Katie from his clutches, the trio need to "unveil themselves", which they interpret<br>
                as surrendering an item that is very special to each of them. Wren brings a piece of handmade pottery that she created<br>
                when she was five years old, Chloe offers a picture of her and her father taken prior to his passing a few months afterwards,<br>
                and Hallie relinquishes her younger sister Lizzieâ€™s blanket, woven by their grandmother upon her birth. Having researched Slender<br>
                Man mythology, Wren instructs Hallie and Chloe to don blindfolds and warns the pair against removing them or opening their eyes<br>
                to look directly at his face while contacting him, even if they hear something, for fear of death or madness. However,<br>
                Chloe panics and flees, meeting the Slender Man up close. Sometime later, he enters Chloe's house and drives her mad.
                <br>
                Wren, suffering from frightening visions, researches further about the figure in the local library, where it attacks<br>
                her, and Hallie unsuccessfully attempts to move on from the issue by spending the night with her boyfriend Tom, for<br>
                which Wren chastises her. Meanwhile, Lizzie suffers a major panic attack and is hospitalized and sedated. Scouring her<br>
                computer, Hallie discovers that Wren, aided by Lizzie, had attempted to contact the Slender Man.
                <br>
                Heading to Wren's residence to confront her, Hallie encounters information that Wren gathered in her bedroom concerning<br>
                Slender Man and his victims, one of whom was Allison Riley, a psychiatric patient who claimed that the malevolent entity<br>
                absconded with nine of her peers. After Hallie dissuades her from committing suicide, Wren, feeling guilty for causing the<br>
                recent chain of events, breaks down and confesses that Lizzie approached her with interest in the Slender Man and asked that<br>
                she accompany her to the woods, where she offered her teddy bear to him. She then admits that the sacrifices they gave him<br>
                earlier were insufficient, as he will only rest once he has seized all of them physically. Suddenly, Slender Man shatters<br>
                the glass window and kidnaps her, pulling her outside with his tentacles appearing in the shape of branches. Hallie, now<br>
                realizing that her sole available option for rescuing Lizzie is to sacrifice herself to him, ventures into the wooded<br>
                area to deal with him upfront. Encountering the monster, she pleads for him to take her instead. He obliges, and moves<br>
                to grab her as she tries to escape. Using his enormous appendages to traverse the forest like a spider, he grabs and<br>
                ensnares her, both of them fusing together as a tree. Lizzie awakens in the hospital screaming for her sister, but<br>
                ultimately makes a successful recovery and reflects on what happened to the quartet.</p>
